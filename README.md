In application development, a tier represents a logical or physical separation of components based on their function. In AWS, you can design and deploy applications using different tiered architectures, commonly:

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 1. Single-Tier Architecture

All components (UI, logic, and data) run on a single server.

Use case: Small web apps, prototypes, dev/testing.

AWS Services:
	â€¢	Amazon EC2 (single instance)
	â€¢	Amazon Lightsail
	â€¢	Elastic Beanstalk (single instance)
	â€¢	Local SQLite/MySQL

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 2. Two-Tier Architecture

Divides the app into two parts:
Tier 1: Client/UI and application logic
Tier 2: Database layer

Use case: Basic web apps with some separation of logic and storage.

AWS Services:
	â€¢	Frontend/Logic: EC2, AWS Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
	â€¢	Database: Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, DynamoDB

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 3. Three-Tier Architecture (Most Common)

Separation of concerns:
	â€¢	Presentation Layer (Web/UI)
	â€¢	Application Layer (Business Logic)
	â€¢	Data Layer (Database)

Use case: Scalable and maintainable web applications.

AWS Services:
	â€¢	Presentation: Amazon S3 + CloudFront (static), EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Amplify (for frontend)
	â€¢	Application Logic: EC2 Auto Scaling, AWS Lambda, Fargate (for containers)
	â€¢	Data Layer: RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, S3 (for object storage)

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 4. N-Tier (Multi-Tier) Architecture

Adds more abstraction layers like:
	â€¢	API Layer
	â€¢	Microservices Layer
	â€¢	Caching Layer
	â€¢	Messaging Layer
	â€¢	Monitoring Layer

Use case: Large enterprise apps or microservices-based apps.

AWS Services:
	â€¢	API Gateway: For APIs and routing
	â€¢	Lambda / ECS / EKS: For backend logic/microservices
	â€¢	SQS / SNS / EventBridge: For decoupling services
	â€¢	ElastiCache: For Redis/Memcached caching
	â€¢	CloudWatch / X-Ray: For logging, monitoring

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 5. Serverless Architecture (event-driven, no infrastructure to manage)

No traditional tiers, but logical separation still exists.

Use case: Event-driven apps, lightweight backend, real-time apps.

AWS Services:
	â€¢	Frontend: S3 + CloudFront
	â€¢	Compute: AWS Lambda
	â€¢	API: Amazon API Gateway
	â€¢	Storage: DynamoDB, S3
	â€¢	Auth: Amazon Cognito
	â€¢	Event: SQS, SNS, Step Functions
